# On dimensionality of feature vectors in MPNNs (ICML 2024)
Official Julia implementation of the paper: "On dimensionality of feature vectors in MPNNs".

## Getting Started

### Setup 
1.  Download the repo:
```bash
---
```
2. Install Julia
- For Windows
     
```bash
winget install julia -s msstore
